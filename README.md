# ImageCaster for Docker [![Matrix]][matrix-community] [![Discord]][discord-guild] [![Docker]][docker-image] [![Build]][gitlab] [![Donate]][elypia-donate]
## Docker Images
There are 3 deployments of ImageCaster, each corresponding to builds of
ImageMagick: Q16-HDRI, Q16, and Q8. By not specifying which you'll use
Q16-HDRI by default which should be good for most use cases, but using
Q16, or Q8 can yield substantially quickly build times if your
requirements allow it.

* [`x.y.z-q16-hdri`, `x.y-q16-hdri`, `x-q16-hdri`, `latest-q16-hdri`, `q16-hdri`, `x.y.z`, `x.y`, `x`, `latest`][q16-hdri]
* [`x.y.z-q16`, `x.y-q16`, `x-q16`, `q16`][q16]
* [`x.y.z-q8`, `x.y-q8`, `x-q8`, `q8`][q8]

## About ImageCaster
ImageCaster is a small CLI application that can be used to manage
exporting images. It's primary use case is for CI/CD where a
repository that has a set of images as a source and programmatically
produces images as a result of a build.
